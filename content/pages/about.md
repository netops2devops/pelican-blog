# Hello world! 🚀

Welcome to my blog. My name is Kapil Agrawal and I am a *Security Engineer* by profession. Prior to moving into a Cybersecurity role, I was a Network Engineer and had several years of experience in service provider and HPC data center networking and automation. I have many interests most of which involve systems, networking, security, software and automation. In my downtime I enjoy hiking, kayaking or working out (HIIT), gaming, traveling to new places or spending time with Juniper (my cat) 🐱 On this blog I plan on journaling anything new that I learn as I grow into a better engineer. 

Thanks for stopping by.

Ciao! 👋
